## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The navbar has links to a search page and a login/signup modal. When the user is logged in, there is a third option for a saved books page. On the search books page, there is an input field to query the Google Books Api, displaying a short list of matching entries with their titles, authors, descriptions, thumbnails, and links to their Google Books pages. When the user is signed in, there is also a button to save the book to the user's list. Once a book has been saved, the user can view it on the saved books page, where it is displayed with all of the corresponding data, in addition to a button that allows the user to remove the book from their list.

## Credits
